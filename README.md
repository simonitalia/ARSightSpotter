# Application Name
AR Sight Spotter

# Objective
The objective of this app is to overlay (augment) the real world with information (text) about what's around the user. The app works by using the iPhone camera to display the real world, the CoreLocation framework to figure out where in the world the user is, the wikipedia API to download data of based on the user's location, and the ARKit framework to overlay the additional, virtual data (node objects).
